# tutorial_R_d3_force_network_viz
We provide a tutorial on our workflow to generate force-networks in D3,  starting with data in R data


### What this tutorial shows

Working on different stories and visualizations at compscjournalism.org, (social) networks are one of our highly favored types of visualizations. With a stronger background in R-programming and a desire to tell stories on digital platforms in an intuitive, interactive fashion, we developed a workflow combining data preparation and analysis in R and visualization of networks using Javascript, in particular D3.  Here, we present this workflow starting from sample data of a social network in R, right until the visualized SVG (based on JS and D3) in an.html document. The resulting visualization can be found here


### Tutorial/workflow structure

* Data preparation in R
* write data to JSON object
* read JSON object in Javascript function to create a network

Within the following section, I will go through these sections briefly and link you to the more detailed tutorials on R and D3 that cover the workflow in greater detail.
